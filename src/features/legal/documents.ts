        'We keep a short record of which days you practised and what you did (for example a lesson or a review) to show your streak and plan each day. It is kept for 120 days and synced to your account. If you turn on daily reminders, they are scheduled on your phone only; no reminder data is sent to us, and you can turn them off at any time in Settings.',

Assessment transcripts are processed by xAI, or OpenAI when xAI is unavailable, to produce a non-certified language estimate.',

Cancellation stops future renewals; access continues until the paid period ends unless the purchase is refunded or revoked. Manage or cancel from the Vokeno Plus screen or your store account. Deleting the app or your Vokeno account does not cancel billing. Restore purchases using the same Vokeno and store accounts. Purchases cannot be restored to a new Vokeno account after permanently deleting the original account, so cancel your subscription before account deletion.',
